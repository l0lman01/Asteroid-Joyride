# Note: do not force NODE_ENV=production here — Netlify needs devDependencies
# (webpack, babel, etc.) available during the build. If you set NODE_ENV to
# "production" at build time, npm may skip installing devDependencies and the
# build will fail with missing tools. Leave environment vars to Netlify UI if
# you need them, or explicitly set NPM_FLAGS to include dev deps instead.
